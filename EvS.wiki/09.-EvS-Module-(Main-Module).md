This is the main module of the tool, from which all functionality originates. The package has an inner structure similar to the entire project, meaning there is an EvS package for every ED algorithm, an EvS experimenter and an EvS evaluator package.

If you wish to add a new ED algorithm you have at first to update the _EvS_ class with the new code. Also, if you wish to add a Sentiment version of your algorithm, you have to place the code in this package and update the _EvS_ class appropriately.

[5. Event Detection Module](https://github.com/Lefteris008/EvS/wiki/5.-Event-Detection-Module) has all the information you need.
