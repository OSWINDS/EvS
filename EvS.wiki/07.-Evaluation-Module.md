The Evaluator Module provides functionality in order to evaluate a given Event Detection algorithm, comparing its results to a specified ground truth dataset.

**How to implement an Evaluator for my new ED algorithm?**

You have to implement the AbstractEvaluator interface and implement all of its methods. The process of loading the ground truth data occurs once in the default constructor (_loadGroundTruth()_) and you have to specifically write your own code that loads the aforementioned set.

**Do I have to follow a specific schema for my ground truth set?**

No, you are free to use your own schema and no specific structure is provided. As the file is loaded inside the _loadGroundTruth()_ method, you can use whatever schema you wish.
