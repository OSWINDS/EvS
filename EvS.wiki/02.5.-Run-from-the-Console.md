You can run the tool externally, using the terminal console of your computer. The main class of it is _EvS_ and you can use (as of now) 4 flags:
* `-mongoL` flag: Shows Mongo Logging Information. By default, the Mongo Logging Information is _hidden_ to avoid distraction. If set, the argument informs the tool to show the output of MongoDB Log. Ignore it for the default behavior.
* `-inline` flag: Shows Inline Information. Same as with the previous flag by setting this argument, the tool is informed to show the various inline information during execution. Ignore it for the default behavior.
* `-opf` flag: Runs the Sentiment version of Offline Peak Finding.
    * If you also add `-nosentiment`, the tool will run the simple version of it.
* `-edcow` flag: Runs the Sentiment version of EDCoW.
    * If you also add `-nosentiment`, the tool will run the simple version of it.

All flags are optional and you can run the tool without them and be asked during execution.
