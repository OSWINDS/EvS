In this module, all secondary functionality such as reading from the database, fetching tweets etc resides.

**How can I add or remove fields from MongoDB?**

Assuming that you have updated the database itself, you have to update two classes:
* _Config.java_ that has the setters/getters of every single MongoDB field.
* _MongoHandler.java_ that reads from the database.

**How can I update the input arguments to support my new ED method?**

You have to update the _Console.java_ class and more specifically the _setOptions()_ method. The tool utilizes the Apache Commons CLI library for console parsing, so all you have to do is to add your new arguments and the library will take care of the rest. As the existence of the arguments is checked once at the beginning of the _EvS_ class, you have to create the appropriate public methods that will return the values to the _EvS_ class during execution. Also, don't forget to update appropriately the relevant section of the _config.properties_ file along with the _Config_ class.
