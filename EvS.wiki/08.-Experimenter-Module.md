This module provides functionality for experimenting using the default parameters for your algorithm. Place your code inside the _experimenter_ package.

**How do I implement a new Experimenter for my new ED algorithm?**

There is no abstract interface to be implemented. As this class is parameter-dependent, you have to implement your own testing methods for the parameters of the algorithm. A general advice is to create a method with three basic parameters: the starting value of the parameter, the ending value and a value-step that will increment it by exactly that amount.
Also, consider creating separate experimenter classes for the Sentiment version of your ED algorithm. In our approaches, we also created a method for exporting the results into a text file. Refer to the [experimenter package](https://github.com/Lefteris008/EvS/tree/master/src/experimenter) for more information.
