The project is divided into 7 modules; 5 of them pack the tool's main functionality. One is the main module, that contains subpackages for ED via SA and the seventh one packs useful methods and classes.

The user is free to extend the tool with new modules and submodules (packages inside modules).

All Event Detection algorithms that will be used, must be placed inside the Event Detection Module (_edmodule_) and (optionally) their sentiment versions inside the specific algorithm's subpackage of EvS Module (e.g. for the Sentiment EDCoW, that will be the _evs.edcow_ subpackage).

All Sentiment Analysis techniques that will be used, must be placed inside the Sentiment Analysis Module (_samodule_).

All evaluation techniques, must be place inside the Evaluation module (_evaluator_).

All experimentation approaches (e.g. finding the appropriate values of an algorithm-specific variable etc.), must be placed inside the Experimentation Module (_experimenter_).

Every text specific procedure, must be place inside the Pre-Processing Module (_preprocessing_).
