This module provides functionality for analyzing and exporting the sentiment of a given text.

This module, though separate from the rest of the tool, does not automatically analyzes the sentiment. It rather reads the information from already exported files using a 3rd-party source (in this case, Weka) and annotates the tweets in the MongoDB Store.

Only Stanford Sentiment Treebank was used as a 1st-party source for analysis, but you can extend the package with new functionality.
