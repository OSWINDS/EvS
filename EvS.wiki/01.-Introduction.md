This tool attempts to combine a given Event Detection technique with the sentiment information from the tweets of the dataset.

In particular, it combines the sentiment information of the tweets that belong to a certain event and exports them for further research.

The tool is comprised by seven separate modules; these are the following:
* **Pre-Processing module**, for the process of tokenization, stemming and any language-oriented procedure on the text of the tweets.
* **Event Detection module**, in which one or more ED algorithms are implemented and executed (one at a time).
* **Sentiment Analysis module**, for the SA part.
* **Experimenter module**, in which the main experiments of every technique are executed and the generated results are exported in separate files.
* **Evaluator module**, for the process of evaluating the generated results of the aforementioned techniques, by comparing them with predefined ground-truth data.
* **EvS module**, a module which binds the previous five in unique classes and methods and performs Event Detection via Sentiment Analysis.
* **Utilities module**, for secondary tasks like retrieving the tweets from the database etc.
